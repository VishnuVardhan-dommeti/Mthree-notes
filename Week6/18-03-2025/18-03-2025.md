# Grafana Dashboard Summary

## Panels

### 1. **Global CPU Usage**
Displays CPU utilization across the cluster, including Linux and Windows nodes, along with CPU resource requests and limits.

### 2. **Global RAM Usage**
Monitors memory consumption across the cluster, showing real-time usage for Linux and Windows nodes, as well as resource requests and limits.

### 3. **Nodes Count**
Shows the total number of nodes available in the cluster.

### 4. **Kubernetes Resource Count**
Tracks the count of Kubernetes objects, including namespaces, running pods, services, ingresses, and deployments.

### 5. **Cluster CPU Utilization**
Displays time-series data of CPU usage for Linux and Windows nodes.

### 6. **Cluster Memory Utilization**
Monitors real-time memory utilization trends in the cluster.

### 7. **CPU Utilization by Namespace**
Breaks down CPU consumption per namespace, helping identify high-resource-consuming applications.

### 8. **Memory Utilization by Namespace**
Displays memory consumption per namespace, assisting in resource allocation and scaling decisions.

### 9. **CPU Throttled Seconds by Namespace**
Indicates CPU throttling occurrences across different namespaces, which can highlight resource constraints.

### 10. **CPU Core Throttled by Instance**
Tracks CPU throttling at the node level to diagnose performance bottlenecks.

### 11. **OOM Events by Namespace**
Logs out-of-memory (OOM) events per namespace, crucial for debugging resource allocation issues.

### 12. **Container Restarts by Namespace**
Displays the number of container restarts across namespaces, often indicating instability or failures in deployments.

### 13. **Kubernetes Pods QoS Classes**
Shows the distribution of pods based on their Quality of Service (QoS) class, categorized as Guaranteed, Burstable, or BestEffort.

### 14. **Kubernetes Pods Status Reason**
Summarizes pod status across the cluster, showing reasons for failures or pending states.

## Usage
This dashboard provides real-time insights into the Kubernetes cluster, helping teams monitor system health, troubleshoot issues, and optimize resource allocation effectively.
