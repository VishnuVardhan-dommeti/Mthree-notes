# Detailed Explanation of the Python Code

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Covered
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that models real-world entities using classes and objects. This script demonstrates OOP principles such as **inheritance** (one class deriving properties from another), **polymorphism** (same method behaving differently in derived classes), **method overriding** (subclass redefines a method from the parent class), **encapsulation** (restricting access to certain data), and **abstraction** (hiding complex implementation details). It also covers **constructors and destructors**, **shallow and deep copies**, **static and class methods**, **exception handling**, and **file handling** to build robust and reusable code structures.

## Breakdown of the Code

### 1. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.

#### **Class Definitions and Inheritance**

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

- `__init__`: This is the constructor method, which is called when an instance of `Animal` is created. It initializes the `name` attribute.

```python
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Animal {self.name}"
```

- `__str__`: This method returns a string representation of the object when printed.

```python
    def speak(self):
        print(f"Animal {self.name} is speaking")
```

- `speak`: A method that prints a message. This will be overridden in subclasses.

---

### 2. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows different classes to implement the same interface in different ways. Method overriding and method overloading demonstrate polymorphism.

#### **Method Overriding and Overloading**

```python
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self, age=0):
        return f"Dog {self.name} is barking and {age} years old"
```

- **Method Overriding**: The `speak` method in `Dog` overrides the `speak` method in `Animal`.
- **Method Overloading**: The `speak` method includes an optional `age` parameter.

---

### 3. Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy
A **shallow copy** creates a new object but does not create new instances of nested objects. A **deep copy** creates entirely independent objects.

#### **Shallow and Deep Copy**

```python
import copy

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, address):
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
```

- `copy.copy()`: Creates a shallow copy where nested objects are still referenced.
- `copy.deepcopy()`: Creates a completely independent object.

Example:

```python
address = Address("New York", "USA")
person = Person("John", address)
shallow_person = copy.copy(person)
deep_person = copy.deepcopy(person)
```

- **Shallow Copy**: `shallow_person.address` still refers to the same `address` object.
- **Deep Copy**: `deep_person.address` is a completely new object.

---

### 4. Exception Handling
Exception handling ensures that the program can handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing.

#### **Handling Errors with Try-Except Blocks**

```python
class CustomException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)
```

- This defines a custom exception by inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception` class.

Example:

```python
try:
    raise CustomException("This is a custom exception")
except CustomException as e:
    print(e)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
finally:
    print("Finally block")
```

- The `try` block raises an exception.
- The `except` block catches it.
- The `finally` block runs regardless of exception occurrence.

---

### 5. File Handling
File handling is essential for reading from and writing to files. Python provides built-in functions for file operations.

#### **Opening and Closing Files**
```python
file = open("example.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, this is a test file.")
file.close()
```

- `open()`: Opens a file in write (`w`) mode.
- `write()`: Writes data to the file.
- `close()`: Closes the file.

#### **Reading a File**
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

- `with open()`: Ensures proper file closing.
- `read()`: Reads the entire file content.

#### **Appending to a File**
```python
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nAdding a new line.")
```

- Opens the file in append (`a`) mode to add content without overwriting existing data.

#### **Exception Handling in File Handling**
```python
try:
    with open("non_existent_file.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file does not exist.")
```

- Handles file-related errors gracefully.
