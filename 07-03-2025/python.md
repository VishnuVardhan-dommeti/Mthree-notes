Detailed Explanation of the Python Code
=======================================

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Covered
--------------------------------------------

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that models real-world entities using classes and objects. This script demonstrates OOP principles such as **inheritance** (one class deriving properties from another), **polymorphism** (same method behaving differently in derived classes), **method overriding** (subclass redefines a method from the parent class), **encapsulation** (restricting access to certain data), and **abstraction** (hiding complex implementation details). It also covers **constructors and destructors**, **shallow and deep copies**, **static and class methods**, **exception handling**, and **file handling** to build robust and reusable code structures.

Breakdown of the Code
---------------------

### 1\. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.

#### **Class Definitions and Inheritance**

```
class Animal:

def \_\_init\_\_(self, name):

self.name \= name
```


*   `__init__`: This is the constructor method, which is called when an instance of `Animal` is created. It initializes the `name` attribute.
    

```
def \_\_str\_\_(self):

return f"Animal {self.name}"
```

*   `__str__`: This method returns a string representation of the object when printed.
    

```
def speak(self):

print(f"Animal {self.name} is speaking")
```
*   `speak`: A method that prints a message. This will be overridden in subclasses.
    

* * *

### 2\. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows different classes to implement the same interface in different ways. Method overriding and method overloading demonstrate polymorphism.

#### **Method Overriding and Overloading**

```
class Dog(Animal):

def speak(self, age\=0):

return f"Dog {self.name} is barking and {age} years old"
```

*   **Method Overriding**: The `speak` method in `Dog` overrides the `speak` method in `Animal`.
    
*   **Method Overloading**: The `speak` method includes an optional `age` parameter.
    

* * *

### 3\. Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy

A **shallow copy** creates a new object but does not create new instances of nested objects. A **deep copy** creates entirely independent objects.

#### **Shallow and Deep Copy**

```
import copy

  

class Person:

def \_\_init\_\_(self, name, address):

self.name \= name

self.address \= address
```

*   `copy.copy()`: Creates a shallow copy where nested objects are still referenced.
    
*   `copy.deepcopy()`: Creates a completely independent object.
    

Example:

```
address \= Address("New York", "USA")

person \= Person("John", address)

shallow\_person \= copy.copy(person)

deep\_person \= copy.deepcopy(person)
```

*   **Shallow Copy**: `shallow_person.address` still refers to the same `address` object.
    
*   **Deep Copy**: `deep_person.address` is a completely new object.
    

* * *

### 4\. Exception Handling

Exception handling ensures that the program can handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing.

#### **Handling Errors with Try-Except Blocks**

```
class CustomException(Exception):

def \_\_init\_\_(self, message):

self.message \= message

super().\_\_init\_\_(self.message)
```

*   This defines a custom exception by inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception` class.
    

Example:

```
try:

raise CustomException("This is a custom exception")

except CustomException as e:

print(e)

except Exception as e:

print(e)

finally:

print("Finally block")
```

*   The `try` block raises an exception.
    
*   The `except` block catches it.
    
*   The `finally` block runs regardless of exception occurrence.
    

* * *

### 5\. File Handling

File handling is essential for reading from and writing to files. Python provides built-in functions for file operations.

#### **Opening and Closing Files**

```
file \= open("example.txt", "w")

file.write("Hello, this is a test file.")

file.close()
```
*   `open()`: Opens a file in write (`w`) mode.
    
*   `write()`: Writes data to the file.
    
*   `close()`: Closes the file.
    

#### **Reading a File**

```
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:

content \= file.read()

print(content)
```

*   `with open()`: Ensures proper file closing.
    
*   `read()`: Reads the entire file content.
    

#### **Appending to a File**

```
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:

file.write("\\nAdding a new line.")
```

*   Opens the file in append (`a`) mode to add content without overwriting existing data.
    

#### **Exception Handling in File Handling**

```
try:

with open("non\_existent\_file.txt", "r") as file:

content \= file.read()

print(content)

except FileNotFoundError:

print("Error: The file does not exist.")
```

*   Handles file-related errors gracefully.
    

* * *
