Introduction
------------

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. It helps manage distributed applications at scale.

* * *

Core Components
---------------

### Control Plane

*   **API Server**: Central management entity, exposes the Kubernetes API.
    
*   **etcd**: Stores cluster state.
    
*   **Controller Manager**: Ensures the cluster's desired state.
    
*   **Scheduler**: Assigns workloads to nodes.
    

### Worker Nodes

*   **Kubelet**: Ensures container runtime and pod execution.
    
*   **Kube-proxy**: Manages networking and service communication.
    
*   **Container Runtime**: Executes containerized applications (e.g., Docker, containerd).
    

* * *

Key Concepts
------------

### Pods

*   Smallest deployable unit.
    
*   Can contain multiple containers sharing storage/network.
    

### Services

*   Provides stable networking to expose applications.
    

### Namespaces

*   Virtual clusters within Kubernetes for organizing resources.
    

### ConfigMaps & Secrets

*   Store configuration and sensitive data securely.
    

* * *

Networking in Kubernetes
------------------------

Kubernetes networking allows pods and services to communicate internally and externally.

*   **ClusterIP**: Internal communication within the cluster.
    
*   **NodePort**: Exposes a service on a static port.
    
*   **LoadBalancer**: Integrates with cloud providers for external access.
    

**Example:**

apiVersion: v1

kind: Service

metadata:

name: my-service

spec:

type: LoadBalancer

selector:

app: my-app

ports:

\- protocol: TCP

port: 80

targetPort: 9376

* * *

Storage in Kubernetes
---------------------

Kubernetes provides persistent storage to containers using **Persistent Volumes (PV)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**.

**Example:**

apiVersion: v1

kind: PersistentVolumeClaim

metadata:

name: my-pvc

spec:

accessModes:

\- ReadWriteOnce

resources:

requests:

storage: 1Gi

* * *

Deployment Scenarios
--------------------

### Scenario 1: Deploying a Web Application

1.  Create a **Deployment** for application pods.
    
2.  Expose it using a **Service**.
    
3.  Use an **Ingress Controller** for domain-based routing.
    

**Deployment Example:**

apiVersion: apps/v1

kind: Deployment

metadata:

name: web-app

spec:

replicas: 3

selector:

matchLabels:

app: web

template:

metadata:

labels:

app: web

spec:

containers:

\- name: web-container

image: nginx

ports:

\- containerPort: 80

### Scenario 2: Scaling an Application

Kubernetes enables automatic scaling with **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**.

apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2

kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler

metadata:

name: web-hpa

spec:

scaleTargetRef:

apiVersion: apps/v1

kind: Deployment

name: web-app

minReplicas: 2

maxReplicas: 10

metrics:

\- type: Resource

resource:

name: cpu

targetAverageUtilization: 50

* * *

Visual Explanation with Images
------------------------------

Here are visual explanations to make concepts clearer:

### Kubernetes Architecture

  

### Pod Lifecycle

  

### Service Communication

  

* * *

Real-World Example
------------------

Let's say we are deploying an **E-commerce Website** using Kubernetes:

1.  **Frontend** (React) â†’ Runs inside a pod.
    
2.  **Backend** (Django) â†’ Runs in a separate pod.
    
3.  **Database** (MySQL) â†’ Uses Persistent Volume for data storage.
    
4.  **LoadBalancer Service** â†’ Exposes frontend to users.
    
5.  **Ingress Controller** â†’ Routes traffic based on domains.
    

**Deployment Architecture:**

\[User\] --> \[Ingress\] --> \[Frontend Service\] --> \[Backend Service\] --> \[Database\]

* * *

Advanced Topics
---------------

*   **Helm Charts**: Package manager for Kubernetes applications.
    
*   **Kustomize**: Declarative customization of Kubernetes YAML files.
    
*   **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control for security.
    
*   **Monitoring**: Use Prometheus and Grafana for logging and alerts.
    

* * *

This documentation provides **a complete guide to Kubernetes**, covering architecture, networking, storage, real-world examples, and images for better visualization. ðŸš€

## Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code using objects and classes. It helps in structuring complex programs by encapsulating related properties and behaviors into objects. This approach improves code reusability, scalability, and maintainability. 

In Python, OOP is implemented using **classes and objects**. A class defines a blueprint, and an object is an instance of that blueprint. This guide will cover all OOP concepts in Python with real-world analogies, explanations, and code examples.

## Inheritance
### What is Inheritance?
**Inheritance** is one of the key principles of OOP that allows a class (child class) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (parent class). This promotes code reusability and hierarchical relationships between classes.

### Why Use Inheritance?
- Reduces code duplication
- Establishes relationships between classes
- Enhances code maintainability

### Types of Inheritance:
1. **Single Inheritance:** A child class inherits from one parent class.
2. **Multiple Inheritance:** A child class inherits from more than one parent class.
3. **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits from another class, which in turn inherits from another class.
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.
5. **Hybrid Inheritance:** A combination of multiple types of inheritance.

### Example: Single Inheritance
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Bark"

# Creating an instance
dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.name)   # Output: Buddy
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Bark
```

### Example: Multiple Inheritance
```python
class Flyer:
    def fly(self):
        return "I can fly"

class Swimmer:
    def swim(self):
        return "I can swim"

class Duck(Flyer, Swimmer):
    pass

duck = Duck()
print(duck.fly())  # Output: I can fly
print(duck.swim())  # Output: I can swim
```

### Example: Multilevel Inheritance
```python
class Animal:
    def breathe(self):
        return "Breathing"

class Mammal(Animal):
    def feed_milk(self):
        return "Feeding milk"

class Dog(Mammal):
    def bark(self):
        return "Barking"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.breathe())  # Output: Breathing
print(dog.feed_milk())  # Output: Feeding milk
print(dog.bark())  # Output: Barking
```

---

## Polymorphism
### What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. This makes the code more flexible and scalable.

### Why Use Polymorphism?
- Allows different objects to share the same interface
- Makes code more generic and reusable
- Enhances flexibility in code implementation

### Example: Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal makes a sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow"

def animal_sound(animal):
    return animal.speak()

animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal_sound(animal))
# Output:
# Bark
# Meow
```

### Example: Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism in Other Languages)
Python does not support traditional method overloading, but we can achieve similar behavior using default arguments.
```python
class Math:
    def add(self, a, b, c=None):
        if c is not None:
            return a + b + c
        return a + b

math = Math()
print(math.add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(math.add(2, 3, 4))  # Output: 9
```

### Example: Operator Overloading
Polymorphism can also be implemented using **magic methods (dunder methods)** to overload operators.
```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

v1 = Vector(2, 3)
v2 = Vector(4, 5)
v3 = v1 + v2
print(v3)  # Output: Vector(6, 8)
```
