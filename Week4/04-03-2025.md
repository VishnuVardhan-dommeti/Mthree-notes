# Kubernetes
## What is Kubernetes?
- Imagine you're running a busy restaurant. You need chefs, waiters, dishwashers, and a manager to make everything work smoothly. 
- Kubernetes is like that restaurant manager for your applications. It helps you deploy, manage, and scale your applications efficiently.
- Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Key Concepts:
### Containers:
- Think of containers as pre-packaged meals. Each container holds everything an application needs to run: the code, libraries, and settings.
- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to 1  another.
- **Real-world example**: A food delivery service packs each order into a separate, sealed container. This ensures the food stays consistent and doesn't get mixed up during delivery.

### Pods:
- A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It's like a table in your restaurant where customers (your application's components) sit and work together.
- A pod can contain one or more containers that need to work closely.
- **Real-world example**: One table in the restaurant might have a chef (a container running the backend application) and a waiter (a container running a supporting service) working together to serve a dish.

### Cluster:
- A cluster is a collection of nodes managed by Kubernetes. It's your entire restaurant operation.
- **Real-world example**: All the kitchens and dining areas of all the restaurants that belong to the same chain.

### Control Plane:
- This is the brain of Kubernetes. It's like the restaurant manager who makes all the decisions.
- **Real-world example**: The Restaurant manager observes the number of customers, the amount of food, and the amount of staff, then makes decisions to keep the restaraunt running smoothly.

### Deployments:
- Deployments define how your application should be deployed and updated.
- It's like a set of instructions for your chefs.
- If you need to update your application, the deployment handles it gracefully.
- **Real-world example**: The restaurant manager has a recipe card (deployment) that specifies how many chefs are needed, what ingredients to use, and how to prepare the dish.

### Services:
- Services provide a stable network endpoint for your pods. It's like a menu that customers use to order food.
- Real-world example: The restaurant has a menu (service) that lists all the dishes and their prices. Customers don't need to know which chef is cooking their food; they just order from the menu.

## Kubernetes process:
1.   *You want to run an application*: You create a deployment configuration, telling Kubernetes how many pods you need and what containers to run.
2.   *The API Server receives your request*: Like placing an order with the front desk.
3.   *The Scheduler assigns pods to nodes*: Like the manager assigning customers to tables.
4.   *The nodes run the pods*: Like chefs and waiters preparing and serving food.
5.   *The Controller Manager monitors the cluster*: Like the manager ensuring everything is running smoothly.
6.   *Services provide access to your application*: Like customers ordering from the menu.
7.   *If a pod fails, Kubernetes automatically replaces it*: If a chef gets sick, the manager finds a replacement.
8.   *If your application needs to scale, you can increase the number of pods*: If the restaurant gets busy, the manager adds more tables and staff.

# Components of Kubernetes:
These components generally fall into two categories: the Control Plane and the Nodes.

## Control Panel Components:
The Control Plane is the brain of the Kubernetes cluster, making decisions and managing the overall state of the system. 

-  **kube-apiserver**:
      - This is the front-end for the Kubernetes Control Plane.
      - It exposes the Kubernetes API, allowing users and other components to interact with the cluster.
      - Think of it as the central hub that receives all requests.
 

-  **etcd**:
      -  A distributed ***key-value*** store that stores all cluster data.
      -  It's the "backbone" for storing the ***state*** of the Kubernetes cluster.
      -  It's crucial for maintaining consistency and reliability.
 

-  **kube-controller-manager**:
      -  A collection of controllers that regulate the ***state*** of the cluster.
      -  Controllers handle tasks like node management, replication, and endpoint management.
 

-  **cloud-controller-manager**:
      -  This component interacts with the underlying ***cloud provider*** (if running on the cloud environment).
      -  It manages cloud-specific resources like load balancers and storage.

## Node Components:
Nodes are the worker machines that run the applications.

-  **kubelet**:
